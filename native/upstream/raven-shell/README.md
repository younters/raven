# Shell component

`shell.c` is Raven code, built by `scripts/provision-controls.py` into `raven-shell.dll` on the
public Windows headers. It supplies what the system libraries of the guest cannot answer on their own:

- the common file dialogs: `GetOpenFileNameW`, `GetSaveFileNameW` and the `IFileOpenDialog` /
  `IFileSaveDialog` objects (with `IFileDialogCustomize` check boxes), all driven by one dialog
  template assembled in memory and shown by the dialog manager of the user32 component;
- shell items (`IShellItem`, `IShellItemArray`) and `SHCreateItemFromParsingName`;
- the class registry behind `CoCreateInstance`, which creates the file dialog classes.
- `ExtractIconExW` and `ExtractIconW`: the icons of a program, a library or an .ico file, at the system's large and small sizes.
- UI Automation's reserved "not supported" and "mixed attribute" values, one object each for the process.
- the task allocator, through `CoGetMalloc` and the shell's `SHGetMalloc`.
- the OLE clipboard (`clipboard.c`): `OleSetClipboard` renders a data object's global-memory formats onto the Win32
  clipboard, `OleGetClipboard` answers with a data object reading it, and `ReleaseStgMedium` frees every kind of medium.
- streams over registry values (`SHOpenRegStream`, `SHOpenRegStream2`, `OpenRegStream`), written back when a writable one is released.

Its exports replace the same-named exports of `comdlg32.dll`, `ole32.dll`, `shell32.dll` and `uiautomationcore.dll`
for programs that import those libraries. Setting `RAVEN_TRACE_SHELL` to a guest file path appends one line per
interface request and dialog call to that file.
